In this case, the patient’s primary concern was poor sleep quality due to stress and anxiety. The recommended treatment included taking moringa leaf extract daily along with incorporation of warm milk into their routine. Additionally, they were advised to avoid caffeine after dinner and engage in mindfulness practices such as yoga or meditation before bedtime. These measures helped improve overall wellbeing and led to better restorative sleep patterns.
